# Bemba Language Model (LLM)

This project provides a Bemba language model that can generate text based on user input. The model is fine-tuned using the Hugging Face Transformers library and is capable of producing coherent sentences in Bemba.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- PyTorch
- Transformers

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install torch transformers
```

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Make sure you have your fine-tuned model stored in a directory named `lora_model`. This directory should contain the model and tokenizer files.

## Usage

To generate text using the Bemba language model, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

# Path to your fine-tuned model directory
model_name = "./lora_model"

# Load the tokenizer and model
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Set the pad token
tokenizer.pad_token_id = tokenizer.eos_token_id

# Set the model to evaluation mode
model.eval()

# Prepare your input text
input_text = "ukutendeka lesa ali pangile isonde"  # Example input in Bemba
input_ids = tokenizer.encode(input_text, return_tensors='pt')

# Create attention mask
attention_mask = torch.ones(input_ids.shape, dtype=torch.long)

# Generate text with sampling and temperature control
with torch.no_grad():
    output = model.generate(
        input_ids,
        attention_mask=attention_mask,
        max_length=50,
        num_return_sequences=1,
        do_sample=True,             # Enable sampling
        top_k=50,                   # Use top-k sampling
        top_p=0.95,                 # Nucleus sampling
        temperature=0.7,            # Control diversity
        pad_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id
    )

# Decode the output
generated_text = tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

print("Generated Text:")
print(generated_text)
```

### Example Input

You can test the model by modifying the `input_text` variable. The example input used is:

```plaintext
ukutendeka lesa ali pangile isonde
```

### Output

When you run the script, it will print the generated text based on the provided input.

## Benefits to the Local Community in Zambia

This Bemba language model can significantly benefit the local community in Zambia in several ways:

1. **Cultural Preservation**: By facilitating the generation of text in the Bemba language, the model helps preserve the rich linguistic heritage of Zambia. It enables users to engage with their culture and language in a modern context.

2. **Education**: The model can be utilized in educational settings to assist students in learning Bemba. It can generate stories, exercises, or even translations, enhancing language learning resources and making them more accessible.

3. **Local Communication**: By enabling better text generation in Bemba, this model can improve communication within communities. It can be used in local businesses, community announcements, and social media to promote information sharing in the native language.

4. **Support for Local Content Creators**: Writers, poets, and content creators can use this model to inspire their work or generate content, enriching the local arts and literature scene.

5. **Healthcare Communication**: The model can assist healthcare providers in generating patient education materials or healthcare information in Bemba, making essential health information more accessible to those who are more comfortable in their native language.
